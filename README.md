# The Multiplier Assessment

**Navigate Transition with Clarity**

A free 5-minute assessment helping professionals facing redundancy, retirement, or career change discover their unique transition pattern.

## ðŸŽ¯ What It Does

- **Motivation** (M) - Your brain's reward system

These don't add together. They **multiply**.

**Transition Success = M Ã— L Ã— I**
