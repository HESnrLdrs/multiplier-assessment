                <p>You have multiple constraints blocking your transition. This is actually more common than you might think, especially for people experiencing imposed change (like redundancy or restructuring).</p>
                
                <p><strong>Here's the truth: You're not more broken than others. You're just experiencing the full impact of a major transition.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Having multiple reds means the change wasn't your choice, you can't figure out the practical steps, and your identity feels threatened. This makes complete sense for someone in your situation.</p>

                <p>This is most common for academics facing sudden redundancy, senior professionals in forced career changes, and anyone experiencing significant imposed change.</p>

                <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
                <p>Multiple constraints create a compounding effect. Each one makes the others worse. But here's what's powerful: <strong>resolving one constraint often creates momentum that helps with the others.</strong></p>
                
                <p>For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fix Motivation â†’ suddenly Learning feels possible</li>
                    <li>Fix Identity â†’ Motivation often returns naturally</li>
                    <li>Fix Learning â†’ confidence improves (helps Identity)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>You don't have to fix everything at once. You just need to start with one.</strong></p>

                    <h3>The Constraint Priority Exercise</h3>
                    <p>Think about these three questions:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>"What's costing me the most right now?"</strong> (M, L, or I)</li>
                        <li><strong>"Which one, if resolved, would help the most?"</strong> (M, L, or I)</li>
                        <li><strong>"Which one feels most accessible to work on first?"</strong> (M, L, or I)</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>Write down your answers. The constraint that appears most is probably your starting point.</p>
                    <p><strong>You don't need to fix everything today. Just identify which one to tackle first.</strong></p>
