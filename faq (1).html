                <div class="faq-question">What is the Navigate Transition Assessment?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    The Navigate Transition Assessment is a research-based tool that helps you understand what might be holding you back during career transitions. It measures three key dimensions: Motivation, Learning, and Identity, and identifies which one is your primary constraint.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How long does the assessment take?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    The assessment takes approximately 5-10 minutes to complete. There are 15 questions, with 5 questions for each dimension (Motivation, Learning, and Identity).
                </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Is my data confidential?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Yes, absolutely. Your responses are stored securely and used only for program development and research purposes. Your personal information is never shared with third parties without your explicit consent.

                <div class="faq-question">Can I retake the assessment?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Yes! You can retake the assessment at any time. We recommend retaking it every 4 weeks during your transition journey to track your progress. Your assessment history is saved so you can see how you've evolved over time.

            <h2>Understanding Your Results</h2>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What is a "constraint" in my results?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Your constraint is the dimension with the lowest score - it's the primary factor that's limiting your forward progress. Think of it like a chain: the weakest link determines the strength of the whole chain. Focusing on improving your constraint will have the biggest impact on your overall transition capacity.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What do the traffic light colors mean?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <strong>Red (Priority):</strong> This is your constraint - the area that needs immediate attention.<br>
                    <strong>Amber (Monitor):</strong> These areas are okay but could be improved.<br>
                    <strong>Green (Strong):</strong> These are your strengths - areas where you're doing well.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What is the Transition Capacity Score?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    The Transition Capacity Score is calculated by multiplying your three dimension scores together (Motivation × Learning × Identity). Each dimension is scored from 1-10, so your Transition Capacity ranges from 1 to 1,000. Because it's a multiplier, improving your lowest score (constraint) has the biggest impact on your overall capacity.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What do the Transition Capacity Score ranges mean?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    The score ranges from 1 to 1,000 (calculated by multiplying three scores of 1-10). For reference: 1-200 is "Building Foundation", 201-500 is "Gaining Traction", and 501-1000 is "Making Progress". The multiplier helps capture how the three dimensions work together.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What if two or more dimensions have the same score?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    If you have tied scores for your lowest dimension, all tied dimensions are marked as constraints. This means you have multiple areas to focus on. The assessment will help you understand each area and create a plan to address them.

            <h2>The Three Dimensions</h2>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What does "Motivation" measure?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Motivation measures your drive, energy, and sense of purpose during the transition. It includes your clarity about why you're making this change, your confidence that it's possible, and your ability to maintain momentum even when things get difficult. Scored from 1-10.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What does "Learning" measure?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Learning measures your openness to new information, your willingness to experiment and make mistakes, and your ability to reflect on experiences and adjust your approach. It's about how effectively you're acquiring the new knowledge and skills needed for your transition. Scored from 1-10.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What does "Identity" measure?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Identity measures how comfortable you are with your evolving sense of self during the transition. It includes your ability to let go of old professional identities, embrace new roles and possibilities, and navigate the uncomfortable "in-between" space of not being who you were but not yet being who you're becoming. Scored from 1-10.

            <h2>Taking Action</h2>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What should I do with my results?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Start by focusing on your constraint (the dimension marked in red). Review the specific questions where you scored low and think about concrete actions you can take to improve in that area. The Navigate Transition Programme provides structured support for each dimension.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How can I improve my scores?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Each dimension has specific strategies for improvement. For Motivation, focus on clarifying your "why" and building confidence. For Learning, practice experimentation and reflection. For Identity, work on self-awareness and embracing change. The full programme provides detailed guidance for each area.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Do I need to work on all three dimensions?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    While all three dimensions are important, you'll see the fastest progress by focusing first on your constraint (lowest score). Once you've strengthened that area, you can work on the other dimensions. The multiplier effect means improving your weakest area has the biggest impact.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Yes! Your results are saved to your account. Simply log in with your email and password, and you can view your current results and assessment history at any time.
