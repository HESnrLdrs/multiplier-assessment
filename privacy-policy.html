        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2025</p>

        <p>Hello! I'm Paul Thomas, and I run Navigating Transitions. I take your privacy seriously, and I want to be completely transparent about how I handle your information.</p>

        <p>This policy explains what data I collect, why I collect it, how I use it, and your rights. I've written it in plain English because privacy policies shouldn't require a law degree to understand.</p>

        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p><strong>Navigating Transitions</strong> is run by Paul Thomas Coaching Ltd.</p>
        <p>When I say "I", "me", or "my" in this policy, that's who I'm referring to.</p>

        <h2>What Information I Collect</h2>
        <p>When you use the Navigating Transitions Assessment, I collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Your name and email address</strong> – so I can create your account and send you your results</li>
            <li><strong>Your assessment responses</strong> – the answers you give to the 15 questions about motivation, learning, and identity</li>
            <li><strong>Your scores</strong> – the results calculated from your responses</li>
            <li><strong>Assessment history</strong> – if you take the assessment multiple times, I keep track so you can see your progress</li>
            <li><strong>Technical information</strong> – basic stuff like your IP address and browser type, which helps me keep the site secure and working properly</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why I Collect This Information</h2>
        <p>I collect this data for specific, legitimate reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To provide the assessment</strong> – I can't calculate your results or show you your progress without storing your responses</li>
            <li><strong>To help you track your development</strong> – keeping your assessment history lets you see how you're progressing over time</li>
            <li><strong>To communicate with you</strong> – I need your email to send you assessment results and respond to any questions</li>
            <li><strong>To improve the service</strong> – understanding how people use the assessment helps me make it better</li>
            <li><strong>To meet legal requirements</strong> – keeping certain records helps me comply with tax, accounting, and business regulations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How I Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Here's what I do (and don't do) with your data:</p>
        
        <p><strong>What I DO use it for:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Providing your assessment results and tracking your progress</li>
            <li>Responding to your questions or requests for support</li>
            <li>Sending you information you've requested about the Navigating Transitions programme</li>
            <li>Improving the assessment based on how it's being used (in aggregate, anonymous form)</li>
            <li>Complying with legal obligations</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>What I DON'T do with it:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sell it to anyone</li>
            <li>Share it with advertisers</li>
            <li>Use it to spam you with marketing emails (unless you've specifically opted in)</li>
            <li>Share your individual responses or scores with anyone else without your explicit permission</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How I Protect Your Information</h2>
        <p>Your data security matters to me. Here's how I keep your information safe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Secure storage</strong> – All data is stored using Google Firebase, which uses industry-standard encryption and security measures</li>
            <li><strong>Password protection</strong> – Your account is protected by your password (which I never store in plain text)</li>
            <li><strong>Limited access</strong> – Only I have access to the database, and I only access it when necessary</li>
            <li><strong>Secure transmission</strong> – All data sent between your browser and the server is encrypted using HTTPS</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Whilst I take reasonable precautions to protect your information, no internet transmission is ever 100% secure. I do everything I can to keep your data safe, but I can't guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>How Long I Keep Your Information</h2>
        <p>I keep your data for as long as you have an account with me, plus a reasonable period afterwards:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Active accounts</strong> – As long as you're using the service, I'll keep your data so you can track your progress</li>
            <li><strong>Inactive accounts</strong> – If you haven't logged in for 2 years, I'll send you an email asking if you want to keep your account. If I don't hear back, I'll delete your data</li>
            <li><strong>After deletion</strong> – Once deleted, your personal data is removed from active systems within 30 days</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Under UK data protection law (GDPR), you have several important rights:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access</strong> – You can request a copy of all the personal data I hold about you</li>
            <li><strong>Correction</strong> – If any of your data is inaccurate, you can ask me to correct it</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion</strong> – You can ask me to delete your account and all your data at any time</li>
            <li><strong>Portability</strong> – You can ask for your data in a machine-readable format to take elsewhere</li>
            <li><strong>Objection</strong> – You can object to how I'm processing your data</li>
            <li><strong>Restriction</strong> – You can ask me to limit how I use your data</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To exercise any of these rights, just get in touch using the contact details below. I'll respond within one month.</p>

        <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>The assessment uses minimal cookies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Essential cookies</strong> – These are necessary for the site to work (e.g. keeping you logged in)</li>
            <li><strong>No marketing cookies</strong> – I don't use cookies to track you around the web or show you targeted ads</li>
            <li><strong>No analytics tracking</strong> – I don't currently use Google Analytics or similar tools</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>I use a small number of trusted third-party services to run the assessment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong> – For secure data storage and user authentication. They have their own privacy policy at <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a></li>
            <li><strong>Google Calendar</strong> – For booking calls (only if you choose to book a session)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These services process data on my behalf under strict contractual terms. They don't use your data for their own purposes.</p>

        <h2>International Transfers</h2>
        <p>Your data is stored on servers in the European Union (Firebase's European servers). If data ever needs to be transferred outside the EU, I'll ensure appropriate safeguards are in place.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The Navigating Transitions Assessment is designed for professionals and is not intended for anyone under 18. I don't knowingly collect data from children.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>I may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in the service or legal requirements. If I make significant changes, I'll notify you by email.</p>

        <p>The "last updated" date at the top of this page shows when the policy was last revised.</p>

        <h2>Questions or Concerns</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy or how I handle your data, please get in touch. I'm here to help and I'm happy to clarify anything.</p>

        <h2>Right to Complain</h2>
        <p>If you're unhappy with how I've handled your personal data, you have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK's data protection regulator:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Website: <a href="https://ico.org.uk" target="_blank">ico.org.uk</a></li>
